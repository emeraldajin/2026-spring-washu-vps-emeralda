    <h2>The New Turing Test</h2>
    <h3>(By Elan Ullendorff)</h3>
    <h1>Review</h1>
    <p>
        I think the Turing Test Reading presents a really interesting way to view AI usage and art. I distinctively remember in one <br> 
        of my high school art classes there was a debate about what was considered "art." Was a piece of driftwood picked out from <br> 
        a river considered art? If art was evaluated by effort, then the driftwood wouldn't be considered art. However, if art was <br> 
        qualified by intention, then the driftwood would count. The textbook concluded that it was the intent that made art, but <br> 
        that was long before AI-generated content was produced. I feel like the reading proposed a new and updated alternative to <br>
        what qualifies as art by its expression. Art is about human expression so it would make sense to measure artistry by its <br>
        expressiveness, and in relation, humanity.
