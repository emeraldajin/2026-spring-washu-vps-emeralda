    <h1>Review</h1>
    <p>
        I feel like restaurants only put effort into creating websites if the sites are used often (e.g., they're a chain restaurant <br> 
        or their menus change often). I am inclined to feel suspicious of places with overly polished websites since it feels like <br>
        they're trying to compensate for bad food. Still, I can definitely appreciate pictures in a menu. However, menus are usually <br>
        seen in the restaurant, so it makes sense why websites aren't really cared for.
