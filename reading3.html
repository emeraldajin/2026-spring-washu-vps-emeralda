    <h2>Cyborgs vs rooms, two visions for the future of computing</h2>
    <h3>(By Matt Webb)</h3>
    <h1>Review</h1>
    <p>
        Matt Webb's blog presented an interesting reframing of cyborgs as not just some unforeseeable future but rather part of our <br>
        reality by listing everyday examples such as Airpods (and their transparency mode). Somaforming seems less destructive to the <br>
        environment and more adaptive, but to gain technology that allows somaforming, we will exert some kind of force on the <br>
        environment. Still, it seems better than terraforming, especially when so much of our everyday environment has been changed. <br>
        I believe there must be a harmony/compatibility between the two. We shouldn't somaform to the point that we are out of touch <br>
        with our environment, nor should we terraform to the point that we destroy the environment we were made for.
